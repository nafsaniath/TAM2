## Factors Influencing Faculty Members’ Learning  Management Systems Adoption Behavior: An  Analysis Using The Technology Acceptance Model
Faculty members underutilize the Learning 
Management System (LMS), a web-based based technology 
intended to facilitate student learning, despite the ubiquitous 
presence of the system at many universities. Drawing from 
Davis’s (1989) Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this study 
identifies how faculty attitudes toward the LMS impact their 
adoption of this technology. The study focuses on a specific LMS, 
Blackboard. Thirty-six faculty members were invited to complete 
a web-based survey. Directive content analysis was utilized to 
analyze and interpret the survey responses. The study reveals 
that specific challenges including system problems and design 
flaws reduce the overall utilization of the LMS by faculty. 
Recommendations about how to increase the utilization of 
Blackboard among faculty members are included.
